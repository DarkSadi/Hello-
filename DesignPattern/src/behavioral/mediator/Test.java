	 * Mediator design pattern is used to provide a centralized communication
	 * medium between different objects in a system. Mediator design pattern is
	 * very helpful in an enterprise application where multiple objects are
	 * interacting with each other. If the objects interact with each other
	 * directly, the system components are tightly-coupled with each other that
	 * makes maintainability cost higher and not flexible to extend easily.
	 * Mediator pattern focuses on provide a mediator between objects for
	 * communication and help in implementing lose-coupling between objects.
	 * 
	 * Air traffic controller is a great example of mediator pattern where the
	 * airport control room works as a mediator for communication between
	 * different flights. Mediator works as a router between objects and it can
	 * have itâ€™s own logic to provide way of communication.
