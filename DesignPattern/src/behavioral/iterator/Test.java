 * Iterator pattern in one of the behavioral pattern and itâ€™s used to provide a
 * standard way to traverse through a group of Objects. Iterator pattern is
 * widely used in Java Collection Framework where Iterator interface provides
 * methods for traversing through a collection.
 * 
 * Iterator pattern is not only about traversing through a collection, we can
 * provide different kind of iterators based on our requirements. Iterator
 * pattern hides the actual implementation of traversal through the collection
 * and client programs just use iterator methods. Check out Iterator Pattern
 * post for example program and implementation details.
